      <h2>This page is my first attempt, it will improve over time.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Hello, and welcome to my first web page. It is not much yet, but I have high hopes. This page is the first step in a new direction for me as I begin to learn the fundamentals of programming.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The most important lesson I have learned so far about programming is that it can be very frustrating. Also, the more frustrated you get and the more fatigued you become, the more mistakes you make. Its a vicious cycle.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am looking forward to improving upon this first draft. </p>
